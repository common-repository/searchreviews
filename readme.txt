== Description ==

Your visitors love user reviews. Now you can supplement your existing brilliant content with relevant user reviews.

It's really simple: The SearchReviews.com Widget looks at your content and then finds relevant user reviews.

You get:

1. Increased user engagement
2. Boosted SEO from increased time on site
3. More content for your site

== Installation ==

1. Upload `searchreviews.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

One optional setting should be configured before use of the plugin. If you have a Publisher ID (you can sign up at http://searchreviews.com/publisher ), enter it in the widget settings screen.

Posts and pages have a "SearchReviews.com Widget" meta-box. Just add keywords to this box to trigger the widget. Using the widget is optional - if you don't add keywords, the widget won't appear.
